### README for React Project

This is a React project that uses the `react-router-dom` library to create a single-page application (SPA). The SPA has four main components:

* `Navbar`: A navigation bar that allows users to navigate between the different pages of the application.
* `Graphics`: A section of the page that contains graphics and other visual elements.
* `Articles`: A section of the page that contains articles and other written content.
* `Footer`: A footer at the bottom of the page that contains information about the application and its creators.

The `Master` component is the root component of the application. It renders the `Navbar`, `Graphics`, `Articles`, and `Footer` components.

To run the application, clone the repository and run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
yarn run dev
```

The application will then be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

To use the application, simply navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You can then use the navigation bar to navigate between the different pages of the application.

The `Graphics` section of the page contains a variety of graphics and other visual elements. These elements are designed to help users understand the different features and benefits of the application.

The `Articles` section of the page contains articles and other written content. This content is designed to provide users with more information about the application and its creators.

The `Footer` section of the page contains information about the application and its creators. It also contains links to social media accounts and other online resources.
